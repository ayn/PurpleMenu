# PurpleMenu
I wrote this to display my nearest Purple Air AQI with US EPA conversion in my macOS menu bar, tested in Catalina and Big Sur.

There's a basic UI to change sensor to any public Purple Air outdoor sensor, and choose between US EPA, AQandU, LRAPA, and no conversion.

To get a sensor ID, go to [Purple Air Map](http://www.purpleair.com/map?mylocation) in your browser, click/tap on a sensor on the map, look at the url in your browser's location bar, and find the `select=` parameter.
