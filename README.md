I wrote this to display my nearest PurpleAir AQI with US EPA conversion in my macOS menu bar, tested in Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, and Ventura.

There's a basic UI to change sensor to any public PurpleAir outdoor sensor, and choose between US EPA, AQandU, LRAPA, WOODSMOKE, and no conversion.

## How to Install

* Go to [Releases](https://github.com/ayn/PurpleMenu/releases)
* Download `PurpleMenu.zip` from the most recent release
* unzip and launch `PurpleMenu.app`

To get a sensor ID, go to [PurpleAir Map](http://www.purpleair.com/map?mylocation) in your browser, click/tap on a sensor on the map, look at the url in your browser's location bar, and find the `select=` parameter.

To automatically launch PurpleMenu on login, just add it to your [Login Items](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-items-automatically-when-you-log-in-mh15189/mac).
