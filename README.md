# PurpleMenu
I wrote this to display the nearest Purple Air AQI with US EPA conversion in my macOS menu bar, only tested in Catalina.

For now you can change the `sensorId` [here](https://github.com/ayn/PurpleMenu/blob/master/PurpleMenu/AppDelegate.swift#L67) to monitor your preferred Purple Air sensor.

## TODOS

* Settings UI
  * choose nearby sensor
  * choose which conversion (or none) to use
